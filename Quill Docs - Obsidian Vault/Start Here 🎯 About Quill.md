## About

Quill is a productivity and task management app that allows users to create, visualize, organize, plan, distribute, and complete tasks through use of different widgets arranged on an overall board. Each widget allows the user to interact with or view tasks in a different way, and widgets may interact with eachother. Ex: Dragging a task from its place in the list widget to a day in the calendar changes its due date to the date you dragged it to. 

**Core [[Widget List]]:**
- [[List]]
- [[Calendar]]
- [[Habit Tracker]]
- [[Clock]]
- [[Note]]

## Core Values

- Accessibility above all else
	- Economic: Core functionality will never be paywalled
	- Neurodivergency: Widgets designed specifically for different types of brains/processing types, as well as highly customizable settings
	- Accessibility is prioritized and considered the first time around
	- Open-source
- Private, reliable
	- Can be used completely offline 

## How Quill Works in Practice

- You make tasks, entering fields, clicking on dates on a calendar, list, or by using natural language processing.
	- NLP Ex: "walk the dog every thursday eve" becomes a task called 
	  "Walk the dog" which repeats every Thursday at 5 pm (configurable)
- Tasks have an optional start date and required end/due date, so that you can plan when you should be working on it. 
- Tasks can have subtasks/work dates. These could be thought of the days you plan to work on the task.
- These two features allow you to vizualize when you get the task, when it's due, and plan and distribute days you want to work on it appropriately, among your other tasks.
	- Surprisingly, this is a hard to come by feature in most to-do apps.
- The apps dashboard is a grid.
- You can add widgets to the grid and change their dimensions.
- Tasks are synced across the widgets and can be visualized and interacted with in different ways in different widgets, and different widgets will interact with eachother in different ways.
	- For example, dragging a task from the list to the calendar will change it's due date.
- Configurable system will encourage you to distribute work on tasks across the span you are working on it more evenly if you are doing too many tasks for one or more days 

### Ex
- A user has a list and calendar component on their dashboard.
- The user clickt the add new task button and types ‚ÄúStart SWE project this Tuesday and complete by next Tuesday‚Äù in the title box
- The task is translated and the fields are auto-populated
- The user looks it over and submits the task
    - On the list view: A task is added with a round checkbox by this Tuesday with the title ‚ÄúStart SWE project‚Äù. Next tuesday where there is a square check box. The title next to this box reads ‚ÄúComplete SWE project‚Äù.
    - On the calendar view: A line of the same color on the list view is added to the calendar view with the same round start check box and square end box, spanning from this Tuesday to next, horizontally.
- The user renames the title of the due date task to be ‚ÄúTurn in‚Äù
- The user decides they want to work on this project on Wednesday, so they click on the line in the calendar where it passes the Wednesday section in the calendar view. A round checkbox appears.
- They decide to add the title ‚ÄúImplement ideas‚Äù to this new subtask.
- As they progress through the week, each day they see a daily to-do list of the tasks they need to complete. On Tuesday, they see ‚ÄúStart SWE project‚Äù. On Wednesday, they see ‚ÄúImplement ideas‚Äù

# Habit Tracker

A habit tracker where you specify the habits you'd like to build, set a reward, and then each occurence of the habit becomes a task that can be visualized in other components.

## Process

- Add habits you want to start and optionally a reward, and prioritize them
- Choose 1-2 of your top priorities to start doing however often you want
- When you do the thing, make progress towards leveling up. When you don't, progress decreases. 
- When you level up you can get the reward you specified, and the next level becomes harder for that task.
- Eventually you can add more habits and archive those that are now in routine.

# Calendar

Calendar for tasks, by default vizualized like a monthly gant chart. Tasks are represented by lines spanning several days, with a hard check box for the due date and round check boxes for subtasks on different days.

## Ideas
### Timeblock for Subtasks
Or Subtasks or Subtasks? Shoul dnot timeblock for tasks bc they just have start and end



## Calendar Architecture

- Will need a way to drop onto a day and have it change something about that task
- Start with month view and displaying tasks

Quill Planner Builder combines the freedom of a bullet journal with the intelligence and ease-of-use of a to-do app, allowing users to build a highly customizable dashboard of widgets to view and interact with tasks and events. For example, drag a task from your daily overview list to a day on the calendar to change its due date. We are open-source, accessibility and privacy first--always. 

A Python adaptation of a [ROR school project](https://github.com/lilyosah/COSC415-ToDo).

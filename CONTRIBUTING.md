## Setting up the development environment

After the initial set-up instructions are followed to set everything up, you can start the backebnd server and front-end with: 

**Windows:**
```cmd
$ dev-startup-scripts\startQuilDevEnv.cmd
```

**Mac/Unix:**
```bash
$ source dev-startup-scripts/startQuillUnix.bash
```

### Back-End

> **Note:** If Python commands do not work prefixed with `py`, also try `python3` and `python`. It works differently across operating systems.

1. Clone this repo

2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

3. [Set up a Python virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments) 
    named "quill-venv" within the "quill-todo" directory 
    for Python dependencies. It MUST be named quill-venv if you 
    want to use any of the shortcut dev-startup-scripts we have.

    Create the environment

    ```Bash
    py -m venv .quill-venv
    ```

    Use the environment 
    
    ```Bash
    .quill-venv/bin/activate
    ```

    You can tell it's active because the environment name will prefix the command line surrounded by parentheses 
    similar to the following:

    ```Bash
    (.quill-venv) lily@Lilys-Laptop Quill-Todo % 
    ```

4. Add a file called `.env` file to the base project directory

    > **This file should never be pushed to GitHub!**
    
    Add the following values to the file:

    ```
    SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>
    DB_PASSWORD=<your db password>
    ```

    - I believe the key and password values can be anything you want, so replace \<your secret key> and 
    \<your db password> with anything you want. 
    - Add `.` if needed to the front of the file in the directory so it is invisible. (Filename should be: `.env`)
    - In [setup.sql](./dev-startup-scripts/setup.sql), change PASS_IN_ENV to the value of DB_PASSWORD in [.env](./.env). 
        - > **‚ùóDo not push this change, reset it after you init the database.**
    - This allows Django to access the database by reading this password.

5. Install PostgreSQL for our database
    - **Windows:**
        - [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) using installer. Leave configuration defaults as they are.
        - Set environment variables after install following [step 3 of this guide](https://medium.com/@aeadedoyin/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-windows-201906131300-ee75f066df78)
    - **Mac/Unix:**
        - [Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/) using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
            - Pay attention to the directory where it inititlizes the the cluster.
        - Add postgresql installation to your terminal profile. Copy the directory where the cluster was started and then run 
            ```Bash
             echo "export PGDATA='<YOUR PATH HERE>'" >> ~/.zshrc
            ```
            replacing \<YOUR PATH HERE> with the cluster dir.
            - If you are not using ZSH then replace ~/.zshrc in the command above with ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile.
            - This should let you use pg_ctl commands after you close and re-open the terminal.
        - **Note:** After the initial set-up, if you installed via homebrew the server should start automatically when you boot your computer up. 
    - Verify that `pg_ctl status` command can run. 
        - If you see sonething about a server running or not running, you are good, 
        - if it does not recognize pg_ctl as a command you have set the path variables or terminal profile incorrectly.

6. Init the database and server for the first time using dev-startup-scripts

    ---

    > üêõ **Read if the scripts fail**:
    >
    > 1. Please let Lily know or submit a bug report so I can fix them! I am new to scripting and am not working on Unix so I might have missed something.
    > 3. If all else fails, continue with [Manual Back-End Init](#manual-back-end-init) to set it up manually with more detailed instructions.

    ---

    - **Windows:**
        > **üìù Important note for Windows:** You must use Command Prompt if you are using [`virtualenvwrapper-win`](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper-win/) for your virtual environment, it will not work with powershell.
        - Open a terminal
        - Create database and user for Quill

            ```cmd
            dev-startup-scripts\initBEWin.cmd
            ```

    - **Mac/Unix:**
        - Start database server for the first time

            ```Bash
            brew services start postgresql
            ```

        - Create database and user for Quill

            ```Bash
            source dev-startup-scripts/initUnix.bash
            ```

8. Verify success
    - Start psql (used to view and manipulate PostgreSQL databases and data)

        ```cmd
        psql quill_db
        ```

    - In psql (indicated by `$ quill_db=# `), list users under quill_db database

        ```psql
        quill_db=# \du
        ```

        - üîç Verify that you see quill_user
        - If it is there, enter `\q` to quit psql

            > **Other useful psql commands:**
            >
            > - `\q` Quit
            > - `\l` List databases
            > - `\du` List roles

    - ‚úÖ If everything looks good:
        > **‚ùóIMPORTANT NOTE: Remove the db password you added from [setup.sql](./setup.sql).**
        - You're done! Read [Back-End Notes](#back-end-notes)

    #### Debugging Tips

    - ‚ùå Read note at the top of step 7.
    - ‚ùå If it says the server could not start:
        - Try starting and stopping the server manually and the re-run the command to start the database and server from the last step.
            - Run `$ pg_ctl status`. 
            - If it says a server is running, run `$ pg_ctl stop & pg_ctl start & pg_ctl stop`
            - If no server is running, run `$ pg_ctl start & pg_ctl stop`
            - Rerun the command to start the database and server from the last step.
        - If that does not work, continue with debugging steps below

#### Manual Back-End Init

1. Switch to virtual environment following instructions of whichever virtual environment you're using (something like `$ source .quill-venv/bin/activate`)
  
    > **Note for Windows:** You must use Command Prompt if you are using [`virtualenvwrapper-win`](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenvwrapper-win/), it will not work with powershell.
    - Start psql

        ```cmd
        $ psql postgres
        ```

    - Run all SQL commands in [setup.sql](./setup.sql), replacing PASS_IN_ENV with the same password you wrote in .ENV (Eventually we will automate this process). When you're done, quit psql with `\q`.

    ‚ùó**Make sure you don't commit setup.sql with the password in it in git.**

2. Install dependencies:  

    Make sure your Python virtual environment is activated, and then run:
  
    ```cmd
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure postgres server is running

    ```cmd
    $ pg_ctl status
    ```

    If it says no server is running:
    - **Windows:**

        ```cmd
        $ pg_ctl start
        ```

    - **Mac/Unix:**

        ```cmd
        $ brew services start postgresql
        ```

4. Make and apply migrations:

    ```Bash
    $ py manage.py makemigrations && py manage.py migrate
    ```

#### Back-End Notes

- After this initial setup, you can use the appropriate script for your OS to start the database and server
  - **Windows:** You can use `$ dev-startup-scripts\startBEWin.cmd` to just start the API, or `$ dev-startup-scripts\startQuilDevEnv.cmd` to start the FE and BE at once
  - **Mac/Unix**: `$ npm run start-be-unix`
  - Or just run `$ pg_ctl start` to start the database and `$ py manage.py runserver` to start the server (make sure your virtual environment is active)

- If you follow the url the server is running on you will get an error until you build the front-end app for production. To do that, follow the instructions in front-end and run `npm build`.
- To access the API navigate to [http://localhost:[server port number]/api/tasks/]() in a browser. It will say the port it's running on in the terminal the sever is running in.
You may consider install PgAdmin to make working with databases easier.
- > **Important:** If you install more Python dependencies during development, please run `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` and commit any changes to this file to keep dependencies up to date for everyone else

### Front-end

1. Follow steps for back-end to get database and Django server running

2. Install `nvm` (Node version manager)

    - [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
    - [MacOS/unix](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

    Verify installation with
  
    ```Bash
    nvm -v
    ```

3. Install Node

    > **Note for Windows:** If access is denied on windows, try running commands in Command Prompt with elevated privileges. (Make sure to switch back into venv in Command Prompt.)

    ```Bash
    nvm install v22.2.0 && nvm use 22.2.0
    ```

    You may need to restart your computer for the installation to take effect.


4. Start dev server with `$ npm run start-fe`. If that fails or does not launch a new window, proceed with step 3.

5. Install dependencies:

    ```cmd
    $ cd quill-fe && npm install
    ```

- To launch in development mode:

    ```cmd
    $ npm start
    ```

    It will open the browser window for you.

- To build for production:

    ```cmd
    $ npm build
    ```

    Navigate to the url that the back-end server is running at and it should serve the built app.

#### Front-End Notes

- > **Important:** If you install more npm packages during development, make sure to add the `--save` flag to the install command to automatically update `package.json` and commit any changes to this file. ex: `npm i sass --save`

### Testing

#### Front-end Testing

The test files are stored near the code they test, for most components, in [quill-fe/src/components/__tests__/](./quill-fe/src/components/__tests__/).

##### Running Tests

To run existing tests, from the main directory after switching into your virtual environment (see step 7 in back-end), run `npm run fe-tests`. Alternatively, run the commands manually: After `cd`ing into `quill-fe`, run all tests with `npm test a` or run tests for files that have changed since your last commit with `npm test`.

The tests should re-run automatically every time you save.
Notice that in watch mode, you can press `w` to show options to filter the tests that you run.
You can also isolate the execution of tests to a single test by adding `only` after the test.

**Ex:**
```JS
it.only("should load tasks in the list", async () => {
    render(<App />);
    expect(screen.getByRole("region", {name: "Task list"}))
    .toContainElement(await screen.findByLabelText("Overdue incomplete"));
})
```

Additionally, you can mark a test as not yet implemented by adding `todo`.

**Ex:** `it.quill-be-proj("should do something cool");`

##### Writing Tests
###### Mocking Network Calls

We mock all of our calls to the back-end using declarative statements using [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/docs/). If you don't need to test any special cases (i.e. making sure things behave appropriately if the server returns and error code), feel free to import a default mock server configuration with some dummy tasks from [mockHandlers.js](./quill-fe/src/API/mockHandlers.js). Pay special attention to the optional setup methods. If you want to override one of the mock handlers, I believe it's as simple as adding your function to the beginning of the `mocks` array and marking it as [only needing to be run once](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/response/once).

An example of the default server being used can be seen in [the tests for the list feature](./quill-fe/src/components/__tests__/list.js#L18).

###### Mocking time

Helpfully, [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#settings) exposes a settings module that lets you set the output of `DateTime.now()` ([Example](./quill-fe/src/components/__tests__/list.js#L19-L31)). Mocking any other methods not mentioned in their setting will require using Jest mocks/spies.
